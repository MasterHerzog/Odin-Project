	<h2>Description:</h2>
	<p>My dad's sister gave me this recipe for killer peanut butter cookies made with shortening.</p>
	<h2>Ingrdients:</h2>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>½ cup shortening</li>
			<li>½ cup crunchy peanut butter</li>
			<li>½ cup white sugar</li>
			<li>½ cup packed brown sugar</li>
			<li>1 large egg</li>
			<li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour, plus more as needed</li>
			<li>¾ teaspoon baking soda</li>
			<li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
			<li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<h2>Preparation:</h2>
	<p>
		<h3>Step 1</h3>
		<p>Cream shortening, peanut butter, and both sugars in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in egg until incorporated. Mix flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a separate bowl; gradually stir into peanut butter mixture until combined. Cover and refrigerate dough for at least 1 hour.</p>
		<h3>Step 2</h3>
		<p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
		<h3>Step 3</h3>
		<p>Roll chilled dough into walnut-sized balls and place 2 inches apart onto baking sheets. Flatten dough balls with a fork dipped in flour to form a crosswise pattern.</p>
		<h3>Step 4</h3>
		<p>Bake in the preheated oven until edges are set, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>
